# Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) with TensorFlow Keras

## Introduction
Welcome to the Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN) project! This project aims to provide a deeper understanding of generative models and how they work by implementing a GAN using TensorFlow Keras. Generative models have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their ability to generate new and realistic data. GANs, in particular, have shown remarkable results in generating images, audio, and even text.

## Project Overview
In this project, I have implemented a GAN architecture using TensorFlow Keras. The GAN consists of two key components: the **Generator** and the **Discriminator**. The Generator is responsible for generating synthetic data samples, such as images, while the Discriminator acts as a judge to distinguish between real and generated data.

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of generative models, particularly GANs. By implementing the GAN architecture and training it on specific datasets, we aim to explore various aspects such as training stability, mode collapse, and the impact of hyperparameters on the generated samples' quality.

## Network Architecture
The GAN network architecture involves the design and implementation of the Generator and Discriminator models. The Generator aims to learn the underlying data distribution and generate synthetic samples that closely resemble the real data. The Discriminator, on the other hand, learns to differentiate between real and generated samples. The interplay between these two components creates a competitive game, where the Generator continuously tries to improve its generated samples while the Discriminator strives to become better at distinguishing them.
